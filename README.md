## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

### What I learned

By doing this project, I learned how to use Axios to fetch data easily and it also helped me to get familiar with using API. Also i got to know about a new package [react-device-detect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-device-detect), which helps to know if the site is viewed from a window, mobile, android etc. So, we can conditionally render data based on the device.
